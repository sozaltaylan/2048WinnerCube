# 2048WinnerCube

It's my first game that I cloned from scratch on my own after the simple games I made in my tutorials.
It is very nice to experience the feeling of being able to produce something tangible.
I played for a few hours after getting the apk. :)
I wanted to keep it here so that I could see my progress.
I am aware of the shortcomings and the points where I can be done better. Please do not take this project as a reference.
